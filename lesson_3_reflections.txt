When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you would like to share your work with collaborators, access your work from multiple machines, or back it up online.
You might also want to do that when you are ready to release your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You and someone else might be collaborating on a project and you may not want your friend's changes automatically pulled into your local repository, expesially if you are working on the same file, or if you are working on different versions.
