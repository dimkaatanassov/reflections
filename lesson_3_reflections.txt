When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you would like to share your work with collaborators, access your work from multiple machines, or back it up online.
You might also want to do that when you are ready to release your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You and someone else might be collaborating on a project and you may not want your friend's changes automatically pulled into your local repository, expesially if you are working on the same file, or if you are working on different versions.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

branch: belongs to the same repository. used when a new version or feature is added and we don't want to change the master branch
clone: create a new copy of a repository- local or online.
fork: create a new GitHub copy of a GitHub repository. used when we want to modify someone else's repo but we don't want to change their version of it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you get offline and would like to know what the last version was.
Also allows you to merge that with your current version, and then upload the changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We could each work on their local machine and upload changes onto a shared drive somewhere
We'd have to talk to each other before uploading each change so as to make sure we are not overriding things.
It would be harder to keep track of versions and to merge cnagnes, we'd have to simply divide our projects
into separate and independent chunks so as to not get in each other's way
It would be easier to navigate the system though, since Git and GitHub are quite complicated to learn and use.
