What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates an empty repository in the directory where I run the command, the files in that directory are not yet tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows to create a scetch of what you want to commit, but you can also undo that so it's not like comitting (which you can't take back).
And it's different than the working directory because it doesn't have to contain all the files in it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use the stage to save intermediate changes, or changes to each file as you go, and then only commit once all changes related to the same logical change are completed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I want to create several different versions or a test version with some added features while keeping the master version intact.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
By helping you see the structure and see which commit has which parent commit, and which commit can be reached from where.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
We unify the two branches and the newest commit has all changes from both of them. We represent them as merging into the graph because now we have only 1 branch with all the changes instead of 2.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
-Pros
Faster automatic process, easier
-Cons
You're less aware of how your code changes and may introduce bugs.
